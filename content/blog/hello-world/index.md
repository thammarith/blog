Hello, world!

There could not be any more programmers' way to greet than that.

I have been away from blogging for ages. I couldn't find the perfect blogging platform to use. Wordpress is okay but it's over-kill for me and theming is hard. Also, I have to manage server and other stuff as well. Medium is good, clean, and easy to use but I dislike their business model. I think people should be able to read and pay not pay to read with their three premium stories per month nonsense. I know there is a workaround to read those stories for free but I don't want to support those articles that are ill-written yet put behind a paywall.

The quest to seek the perfect platform continues. I want something simple. The main requirement is that I must be able to write the blogs in the Markdown format. I love Markdown. It's simple, clean, and text-based.

Finally, I found Gatsby. It can generate a static website which means that I don't need to manage the back-end part. I just have to write, build, and ship. That's all! Also, I'm familiar with React as I work with React at my current company. So it's much easier for me to tweak the code to get it my way than using soemthing else like Wordpress.

This blog will be forever evolving. I will tweak and make some experiments with it. It is my playground and sandbox for future projects.

Lastly, I hope I will be more active with writing my blog as everything is in the almost perfect state for me and I have so many things to share and write. I will try to write as frequently as I can.

Thanks for reading. I feel privileged to have you reading my blog.
